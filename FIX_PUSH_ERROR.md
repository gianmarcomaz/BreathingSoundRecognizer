# How to Fix "Repository not found" Error

## üîç The Problem
Error: `remote: Repository not found`

This means the GitHub repository doesn't exist yet.

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. **Repository name:** `BreathingSoundRecognizer` (or any name you want)
3. **Description:** Medical audio monitoring system with breathing and sound recognition
4. **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (you already have files)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, run:

```bash
# If repository didn't exist, just push:
git push -u origin master

# OR if branch is "main":
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: If Authentication Error

If you get authentication error:

```bash
# Try with GitHub CLI:
git push -u origin master

# Or use Personal Access Token:
# 1. Generate token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# 2. Use token as password when pushing
```

## üîß Alternative: Push to a New Repository

### Option 1: Create New Repo with Different Name

```bash
# Remove old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new remote (after creating on GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HackAudioFeature.git

# Push
git push -u origin master
```

### Option 2: Use GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com
# Then:
gh repo create BreathingSoundRecognizer --public
git push -u origin master
```

## ‚úÖ After Creating Repository

Your commands will be:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

This should work once the repository exists!

## üéØ Quick Fix

**Simplest solution:**

1. Create repo at: https://github.com/new
   - Name: `BreathingSoundRecognizer`
   - Leave all checkboxes empty
2. Then push:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

Done! ‚úÖ
