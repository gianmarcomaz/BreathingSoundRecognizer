# 🧠 Algorithms & Signal Processing in Neonatal Respiratory Monitor

## Overview

This project uses a **multi-layered DSP (Digital Signal Processing)** approach to analyze neonatal audio signals and detect critical medical conditions. The system combines:

1. **Signal preprocessing** (noise reduction, filtering)
2. **Spectral analysis** (FFT, frequency domain analysis)
3. **Pattern recognition** (breathing patterns, cry characteristics)
4. **Medical scoring** (disease detection via rule-based scoring)

## 🎯 Detection Pipeline

### Stage 1: Audio Preprocessing

#### 1.1 High-Pass Filtering (`_preprocess_realtime_pcm`)
```python
# Butterworth high-pass filter @ 80 Hz
sos = scipy.signal.butter(4, 80, btype='highpass', fs=sample_rate, output='sos')
audio = scipy.signal.sosfilt(sos, audio_data)
```
**Purpose:** Removes DC offset and low-frequency rumble (handling noise, HVAC)
- Removes frequencies below 80 Hz that don't contribute to breathing analysis
- Used: **Butterworth filter (4th order)**

#### 1.2 Soft Limiting
```python
x = np.tanh(2.5 * x)  # Prevent clipping
```
**Purpose:** Prevents audio saturation and distortion
- Normalizes extreme values using hyperbolic tangent

#### 1.3 Normalization
```python
peak = np.max(np.abs(x))
if peak > 1e-6:
    x = x / peak
```
**Purpose:** Normalizes audio to [-1, 1] range for consistent processing

---

### Stage 2: Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

#### WebRTC VAD Integration
```python
vad = webrtcvad.Vad(3)  # Aggressive mode
is_speech = vad.is_speech(frame, sample_rate)
```
**Purpose:** Detects if audio contains actual voice/cry vs. background noise
- Uses **WebRTC's VAD algorithm** (industry standard)
- Processes audio in 30ms frames
- Calculates VAD activity score (0-1)

---

### Stage 3: Breathing Pattern Analysis

#### 3.1 Multi-Band Spectral Analysis (`analyze_breathing_enhanced`)

The system uses **4 frequency bands** to classify breathing:

| Band | Frequency Range | Pattern Type | Medical Significance |
|------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Gasping** | 0.05-0.3 Hz | Severe distress | Apnea, severe asphyxia |
| **Deep** | 0.1-0.5 Hz | Deep breathing | Slow, controlled breathing |
| **Normal** | 0.5-1.5 Hz | Regular breathing | Healthy newborn (30-60 bpm) |
| **Shallow** | 1.5-3.0 Hz | Rapid/shallow | Tachypnea, cyanosis |

**Algorithm:**
```python
# Apply bandpass filter for each band
for (low, high), band_type in bands:
    sos = scipy.signal.butter(4, [low, high], btype='band', fs=sample_rate, output='sos')
    filtered = scipy.signal.sosfilt(sos, audio_data)
    energy = np.mean(filtered**2)
    breathing_components[band_type] = energy
```

**Purpose:** Identifies dominant breathing pattern type before calculating rate

#### 3.2 Breathing Rate Detection (`calculate_breathing_rate`)

Uses **Hilbert Transform + Peak Detection**:

```python
# 1. Smoothing (reduce noise interference)
smoothed = scipy.signal.savgol_filter(audio, window_size, 3)

# 2. Envelope detection using Hilbert transform
envelope = np.abs(scipy.signal.hilbert(smoothed))

# 3. Find peaks with adaptive threshold
peaks, properties = scipy.signal.find_peaks(
    envelope, 
    height=peak_height, 
    distance=min_distance,
    prominence=0.05
)
```

**Peak Detection Features:**
- **Savitzky-Golay filter**: Smooths data while preserving peaks
- **Hilbert transform**: Extracts amplitude envelope
- **Adaptive threshold**: Uses 60th percentile of envelope
- **Distance constraint**: 0.25s minimum between breaths (max 240 bpm)
- **Prominence filter**: Prevents false positives from noise

**Outlier Removal (IQR Method):**
```python
# Remove outliers using Interquartile Range
q1, q3 = np.percentile(intervals, [25, 75])
iqr = q3 - q1
filtered_intervals = intervals[(intervals >= q1 - 1.5*iqr) & (intervals <= q3 + 1.5*iqr)]
```

**Result:** Breathing rate in breaths per minute (bpm)

### Stage 4: Cry Analysis

#### 4.1 FFT-Based Spectral Analysis (`analyze_cry_enhanced`)

Uses **4 frequency ranges** to analyze cry characteristics:

| Range | Frequency | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Fundamental** | 200-400 Hz | Base cry frequency |
| **Harmonics** | 400-800 Hz | Tonal richness |
| **High freq** | 800-2000 Hz | Intensity, energy |
| **Ultrasonic** | 2000-4000 Hz | Distress indicators |

**Algorithm:**
```python
# Apply Hann windowing (reduce spectral leakage)
windowed_audio = audio * scipy.signal.windows.hann(len(audio))

# FFT for frequency analysis
fft_data = np.fft.fft(windowed_audio)
freqs = np.fft.fftfreq(len(audio), 1/sample_rate)

# Find dominant frequency in each range
dominant_idx = np.argmax(range_fft)
dominant_freq = range_freqs[dominant_idx]
```

#### 4.2 Cry Quality Assessment

Categorizes cry into 7 quality types:

1. **`absent`** - No cry detected
2. **`weak_monotone`** - Weak, single-tone (jaundice indicator)
3. **`weak_intermittent`** - Weak, irregular (asphyxia indicator)
4. **`high_pitched_shrill`** - Very high frequency (severe distress)
5. **`strong_clear`** - Robust, healthy cry
6. **`monotone_normal`** - Single-tone, normal intensity
7. **`rich_toned`** - Multi-harmonic, healthy

**Scoring Logic:**
```python
harmonic_ratio = harmonic_energy / fundamental_energy
high_freq_ratio = high_freq_energy / fundamental_energy

if harmonic_ratio < 0.3 and intensity < 0.2:
    return "weak_monotone"  # Jaundice
elif high_freq_ratio > 2.5:
    return "high_pitched_shrill"  # Severe distress
elif harmonic_ratio > 1.5 and intensity > 0.6:
    return "strong_clear"  # Healthy
```

### Stage 5: Medical Condition Detection

#### 5.1 Disease Scoring System (`assess_medical_condition`)

Uses **weighted scoring** to detect 3 critical conditions:

**A) Birth Asphyxia Detection**

```
Score components:
- breathing_rate == 0 → +1.0 (critical apnea)
- breathing_rate < 20 → +0.8 (severe bradypnea)
- breathing_rate < 30 → +0.4 (mild bradypnea)
- breathing_pattern == "gasping" → +0.9
- breathing_pattern == "absent" → +0.9
- cry_quality == "weak_intermittent" → +0.5
- cry_quality == "absent" → +0.6
```

**Severity Levels:**
- Score > 0.8 → `severe_asphyxia` (EMERGENCY)
- Score > 0.5 → `moderate_asphyxia` (CRITICAL)
- Score > 0.0 → `mild_asphyxia` (WARNING)

**B) Jaundice Risk Assessment**

```
Score components:
- cry_frequency < 250 Hz → +0.4
- cry_intensity < 0.3 → +0.3
- cry_quality == "weak_monotone" → +0.5
- cry_quality == "weak_intermittent" → +0.3
```

**Risk Levels:**
- Score > 0.7 → `high` risk
- Score > 0.4 → `moderate` risk
- Score > 0.1 → `low` risk

**C) Cyanosis Detection**

```
Score components:
- breathing_rate == 0 → +1.0
- breathing_rate > 80 → +0.8
- breathing_rate > 60 → +0.4
- breathing_pattern == "rapid_shallow" → +0.6
```

**Severity:**
- Score > 0.7 → `severe_cyanosis` (CRITICAL)
- Score > 0.0 → `mild_cyanosis` (WARNING)

#### 5.2 Oxygen Saturation Estimation (`estimate_oxygen_saturation_enhanced`)

Derives SpO2 estimates from audio patterns:

```python
base_saturation = 95.0  # Normal newborn baseline

# Adjustments:
if breathing_rate == 0:
    saturation = 0  # Apnea
elif breathing_rate < 20:
    saturation -= (20 - breathing_rate) * 1.0  # Severe bradypnea
elif breathing_rate > 80:
    saturation -= (breathing_rate - 80) * 0.5  # Tachypnea

if pattern == "gasping":
    saturation -= 20
elif pattern == "rapid_shallow":
    saturation -= 10

if cry_quality == "weak_monotone":
    saturation -= 5
elif cry_quality == "absent":
    saturation -= 15
```

**Note:** This is a **simplified estimation**. Real medical devices use photoplethysmography (PPG).

### Stage 6: Composite Distress Scoring

#### Multi-Factor Distress Score (`_calculate_distress_score`)

Combines multiple indicators into a single 0-1 score:

```python
distress_score = 0.0

# Breathing rate component (40% weight)
if pattern == "absent":
    distress_score += 0.4
elif rate out of range (30-60):
    distress_score += 0.2

# Breathing pattern component (30% weight)
if pattern == "irregular":
    distress_score += 0.15
elif pattern == "absent":
    distress_score += 0.3

# Cry analysis component (30% weight)
if abnormal_frequency:
    distress_score += 0.15
if intensity > 0.8:  # Very intense
    distress_score += 0.15
```

**Result:** 0.0 (healthy) to 1.0 (critical distress)
