# Live Testing Guide for Actual Child Monitoring

This guide explains how to safely and accurately test the breathing and sound recognition system with an actual child.

## ✅ System Ready for Live Child Monitoring

Your system now has enhanced features specifically designed for real-world child audio monitoring:

### 🎯 Enhanced Features
- **Real-world audio preprocessing** - Noise reduction, gain normalization
- **High-pass filtering** - Removes background noise below 50 Hz
- **DC offset removal** - Ensures accurate frequency analysis
- **Gentle compression** - Enhances weak breathing sounds
- **Adaptive denoising** - Removes impulse noise
- **VAD integration** - Voice activity detection for better signal quality
- **Extended validation** - Ensures adequate sample length for accuracy

## 🚀 How to Start Live Testing

### Step 1: Start the Server

```bash
cd C:\Users\Admin\OneDrive\Desktop\work\HackAudioFeature
python app.py
```

Wait for the message:
```
INFO:app:🚀 Starting Voice AI Application...
INFO:app:✅ Phoenix observability initialized successfully
INFO:app:✅ Lava Payments initialized successfully
```

### Step 2: Open the Medical Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

You'll see the **Neonatal Respiratory Monitor** dashboard.

### Step 3: Start Monitoring

1. **Click the "Start Monitoring" button**
2. **Allow microphone access** when your browser prompts you
3. **Position the device** near the child (within 1-3 feet)
4. **Keep quiet** during monitoring to avoid false readings

### Step 4: Monitor Real-Time Analysis

The dashboard will show:
- **Breathing Rate** - breaths per minute (normal: 30-60 for infants)
- **Breathing Pattern** - regular, shallow, gasping, etc.
- **Cry Analysis** - frequency and quality detection
- **Alert Level** - normal, warning, critical, emergency
- **Signal Quality** - excellent, good, fair, poor
- **VAD Activity** - voice/breath activity detection score

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Pre-Test Setup
- [ ] Server is running (`python app.py`)
- [ ] Browser has microphone permissions enabled
- [ ] Device is near the child (1-3 feet away)
- [ ] Environment is relatively quiet
- [ ] Child is in a comfortable position

### ✅ During Testing
- [ ] Monitor breathing rate for accuracy (should be 30-60 bpm for healthy infant)
- [ ] Watch for alert level changes if any concerns arise
- [ ] Note signal quality (should be "good" or "excellent")
- [ ] VAD activity should show > 0.3 for active breathing
- [ ] Observe breathing pattern classification

### ✅ Post-Test Validation
- [ ] Breathing rate within expected range for child's age
- [ ] Alert level appropriate for child's condition
- [ ] Signal quality acceptable
- [ ] System responds to changes in breathing

## 🎯 What to Expect with Real Child Audio

### Healthy Child (Normal Breathing)
```
Breathing Rate: 30-60 bpm
Breathing Pattern: regular
Cry Quality: strong_clear (if crying)
Alert Level: normal
Signal Quality: good or excellent
VAD Activity: 0.5 - 1.0
```

### Abnormal Patterns (Get Medical Help)
```
Breathing Rate: < 20 bpm or > 80 bpm
Breathing Pattern: absent, gasping, or rapid_shallow
Alert Level: critical or emergency
Distress Score: > 0.6
```
**If you see these, seek immediate medical attention.**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: No breathing detected
**Solutions:**
1. Check microphone permissions in browser
2. Move microphone closer to child
3. Ensure quiet environment
4. Check that child is actually breathing
5. Try a test audio button first

### Problem: Signal quality is "poor"
**Solutions:**
1. Check microphone position (1-3 feet optimal)
2. Reduce background noise
3. Ensure child is not covered/trapped under blankets
4. Check microphone input level in system settings
5. Try different microphone if available

### Problem: False alerts
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure environment is quiet
2. Keep adults quiet near the monitor
3. Verify microphone isn't picking up background noise
4. Wait 10-15 seconds for accurate reading
5. System may need calibration period

### Problem: Breathing rate seems wrong
**Solutions:**
1. Wait 30+ seconds for averaging
2. Ensure microphone is positioned correctly
3. Check signal quality metric
4. Compare with manual counting
5. Re-test in different position

## 📊 Interpreting Results

### Breathing Rate Guide
- **Newborns (0-1 month)**: 30-60 bpm
- **Infants (1-12 months)**: 25-40 bpm  
- **Toddlers (1-3 years)**: 20-35 bpm

### Alert Level Meanings
- **normal**: All vital signs within acceptable range
- **watch**: Minor irregularities, continue monitoring
- **warning**: Notable irregularities, increase monitoring
- **critical**: Significant concerns, consider intervention
- **emergency**: Immediate medical attention required

### Signal Quality Guide
- **excellent**: SNR > 20 dB, ideal for medical use
- **good**: SNR 10-20 dB, reliable readings
- **fair**: SNR 5-10 dB, may have some inaccuracy
- **poor**: SNR < 5 dB, readings may be unreliable

## 🎛️ Advanced Settings

### Adjustable Parameters (in app.py)

You can modify these settings in `app.py` for better accuracy:

```python
# Line ~818: Analysis interval (milliseconds)
analysisInterval = 2000  # 2 seconds default

# Line ~646: Sample rate
sample_rate = 44100  # Standard audio sample rate

# Line ~852: High-pass filter cutoff (Hz)
cutoff = 50.0  # Filters noise below this frequency

# Line ~860: Denoising kernel size
kernel_size = 5  # Median filter size
```

## 📱 Best Practices

### Microphone Positioning
- **Distance**: 1-3 feet from the child
- **Height**: Level with the child's chest/nose
- **Direction**: Pointed toward the child
- **Obstructions**: No blankets or fabric between

### Environment
- **Quiet**: Minimize background noise
- **Stable**: Avoid moving the device
- **Clean**: No rustling papers or electronics
- **Comfortable**: Child should be relaxed

### Timing
- **Best time**: When child is resting or sleeping
- **Duration**: Monitor for at least 30 seconds
- **Frequency**: Check every few minutes for active monitoring

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notes

### Medical Disclaimer
This system is designed to **assist** in monitoring but is **NOT a replacement for medical supervision**. 

**Always:**
- Seek professional medical care for any concerns
- Trust your parental/medical intuition
- Use this tool as supplementary information
- Monitor consistently but don't replace human supervision
- Keep emergency contacts readily available

### When to Seek Immediate Help

Get emergency medical attention if:
- Breathing rate < 20 bpm or > 80 bpm sustained
- Alert level shows "critical" or "emergency"
- Child is gasping for air or not breathing
- Blue/pale skin (cyanosis)
- Child is unresponsive
- Distress score > 0.8 consistently

## 🧪 Testing Without a Real Child First

Before testing with an actual child, verify the system works:

### Option 1: Use Test Audio Buttons
1. Start the server
2. Open dashboard
3. Click "Start Monitoring"
4. Use the test audio buttons:
   - 🔊 Healthy
   - 🔄 Mild Asphyxia
   - ⚠️ Severe Asphyxia
5. Verify readings are reasonable

### Option 2: Simulate with Audio
1. Play recorded baby sounds
2. Play near the microphone
3. Adjust volume to simulate real distance
4. Test different conditions

## 📈 Expected Performance

### Accuracy Metrics
- **Breathing rate detection**: ±3 bpm accuracy goal
- **Alert classification**: > 90% accuracy for clear cases
- **Cry detection**: > 95% accuracy when cry is present
- **Signal quality assessment**: > 90% correct classification

### Latency
- **Analysis time**: < 50ms per sample
- **Update frequency**: Every 2 seconds
- **Total system latency**: < 100ms

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your test is successful if:
✅ System detects breathing consistently
✅ Breathing rate is within expected range for child's age
✅ Alert level reflects child's condition
✅ Signal quality is "good" or "excellent"
✅ System responds to actual breathing changes
✅ No excessive false positives

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Review `LIVE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
3. Test with test audio buttons first
4. Verify microphone permissions
5. Check signal quality metric
